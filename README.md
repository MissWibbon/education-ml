# education-ml

For this machine learning project, our group downloaded multiple years of [College Scorecard Data](https://collegescorecard.ed.gov/data/) to predict student outcomes based off university factors such as acceptance rate, completion rate, transfer rate, size, cost, etc.

Using seaborn.scatterplot and plotting enrollment size vs cost and school type (private or public), we concluded that private universities tend to be more expensive and have fewer students.
